1. A Simple Weight Converter that get inputs and manipulates accordingly
2. it uses Pounds as base value
3.  it converts pounds inputs to Grams , Kilogram, and Ounces 
4.   NB:  1 lbs(pounds) is equivalent to 0.00220406 gram therefore,
          Kilogram could be manipulated thus i.e lbs/2.20406
          while Ounce = lbs *16;

5. Subsequent units and broad conversions would be implemented in next release.
